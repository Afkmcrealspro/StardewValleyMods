# Three Heart Flower Festival Dance Partners
This is the source code. Releases can be found at:
* [My site](http://spacechase0.com/mods/stardew-valley/three-heart-dance-partner/)
* [Nexus](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/500/)
* [Chucklefish forums](http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/three-heart-flower-festival-dance-partners.3767/)

This makes it so that you only need 3 hearts instead of 4 to get a dance partner at the Flower Festival.
